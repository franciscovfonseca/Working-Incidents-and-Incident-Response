<h1 align="center">Working Incidents & Incident Response</h1>

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üìù Context</summary>**

We'll now start practicing **Incident Response**.

We have accumulated a decent number of Incidents over the last 24 Hours:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cce53-082a-4c9e-b6d5-7da25a14a9d7)

<br>

So we‚Äôre going to take our time and work our way through some of these ‚ûú as if we‚Äôre working as a **SOC Analyst**.

Basically in this lab we‚Äôre going to practice the **NIST 800-61 Incident Management Lifecycle**.

In reality ‚ûú every Organization practices Incident Response a little differently than one another.

We won‚Äôt be using here the ‚Äúabsolute best way‚Äù to do Incident Response** ‚ûú but we‚Äôll be adhering to the NIST 800-61 Lifecycle of:

-	**Preparation**
-	**Datection & Analysis**
-	**Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
-	**Post-Incident Activity**

<br>

<h2></h2>

  </details>

<br>


In this lab we're going to **Investigate & Work the Incidents** being generated within **Microsoft Sentinel**.

We'll do this in accordance with the [**NIST 800-61**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf) **Incident Management Lifecycle**.

<summary> <h2>Guidelines for Incident Response</h2> </summary>

<br>

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Preparation

<br>

We've completed this step already by:

- Setting Up **Logging** for all of our Resources.

- **Ingesting all of the Logs** into the **Log Analytics Workspace**.

- Configuring **Microsoft Sentinel** & **Alert Rules**.

<br>

<br>

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Detection & Analysis

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üìù Explanation</summary>**
> 
> This phase gets kicked off when someone notices some kind of **Anomaly in the System**.
> 
> In our case we configured a bunch of Alerts ‚ûú and the fact that an **Incident was Created** ‚ûú is the beggining of our **Detection Phase**.
> 
>   </details>

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1              | Set the **Severity**, the **Status** & the **Owner** of the Incident. |
| 2                | **View Full Details**.                |
| 3     | Observe the **Activity Log** (for the History of the Incident).                    |
| 4  | Observe the **Entities** & **Incident Timeline**.                    |
| 5  | **Investigate the Incident** and continue trying to **Determine the Scope**.                   |
| 6  | **Inspect the Entities** and see if there are any **Related Events**.                   |
| 7  | **Determine Legitimacy** of the Incident.                    |
| 8  | If **True Positive** ‚ûú Continue | If **False Positive** ‚ûú Close it out.                   |

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Containment, Eradication & Recovery

We'll use this simple [**Incident Response PlayBook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ5MzN95POLaRIMulYg3PIH3UGHtDNcGdkFvgOXyEXQ/edit#heading=h.uyxi3urvol4g) to **Remediate the Incidents**.

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí°</summary>**
> 
> We can think of a **Playbook** as an **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** for when a certain Incident happens.
> 
> In general, every Organization has different Playbooks.
> 
> There‚Äôs actually a Playbook functionality built into **Azure** ‚ûú but we‚Äôre trying not to use those automated tools in these labs.
> 
> This is because we want to get a better sense of the ‚ÄúMethodologies‚Äù behind **Incident Response**.
> 
> Instead of just trying to learn tools that are specific to Azure, for example.
> 
> The goal here it to get some practice on how someone would **Respond to Incidents in a Real SOC Environment**.
>

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Post-Incident Activity
