<h1 align="center">Working Incidents & Incident Response</h1>

<br>

In this lab we're going to **Investigate & Work Incidents** being generated within **Microsoft Sentinel**.

We'll do this in accordance with the [**NIST 800-61**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf) **Incident Management Lifecycle**.

<br>

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üìå Overview</summary>**

We'll practice **Incident Response**.

We can see that we have accumulated a decent number of **Incidents** over the last 24 Hours:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/375cac7f-3610-4d11-9cbd-8639ff7e54b4)

<br>

So we‚Äôre going to take our time and work our way through some of these ‚ûú as if we‚Äôre working in a real **SOC Environment**.

As previously mentioned ‚ûú we'll practice the **NIST 800-61 Incident Management Lifecycle**.

üí° In reality ‚ûú every Organization practices **Incident Response** a little differently than one another.

<br>

We won‚Äôt be using here the ‚Äúabsolute best way‚Äù to do **Incident Response** ‚ûú but we‚Äôll be adhering to the **NIST 800-61 Lifecycle** of:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Preparation**

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Detection & Analysis**

**3Ô∏è‚É£	Containment, Eradication & Recovery**

**4Ô∏è‚É£	Post-Incident Activity**

<summary> <h2>üìù Incident Response Guidelines</h2> </summary>
<br>

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Preparation

<br>

We've completed this step already by:

- Setting Up **Logging** for all of our Resources.

- **Ingesting all of the Logs** into the **Log Analytics Workspace**.

- Configuring **Microsoft Sentinel** & **Alert Rules**.

<br>

<br>

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Detection & Analysis

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí° Context</summary>**
> 
> This phase gets kicked off when someone notices some kind of **Anomaly in the System**.
> 
> In our case we configured a bunch of Alerts ‚ûú and the fact that an **Incident was Created** ‚ûú is the beggining of our **Detection Phase**.
> 
>   </details>

<br>

|                   | **Action**                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1              | Set the **Severity**, the **Status** & the **Owner** of the Incident. |
| 2                | **View Full Details**.                |
| 3     | Observe the **Activity Log** (for the History of the Incident).                    |
| 4  | Observe the **Entities** & **Incident Timeline**.                    |
| 5  | **Investigate the Incident** and continue trying to **Determine the Scope**.                   |
| 6  | **Inspect the Entities** and see if there are any **Related Events**.                   |
| 7  | **Determine Legitimacy** of the Incident.                    |
| 8  | If **True Positive** ‚ûú Continue | If **False Positive** ‚ûú Close it out.                   |

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Containment, Eradication & Recovery

We'll use this simple [**Incident Response PlayBook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cua7Kz3Y0OZuPUS0-Q1H7jbwGbYeDq1WISIHrdRk-MY/edit#heading=h.85wjqnr3yu96) to **Remediate the Incidents**.

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí¨</summary>**
> 
> We can think of a **Playbook** as an **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** for when a certain Incident happens.
> 
> In general, every Organization has different Playbooks.
> 
> There‚Äôs actually a Playbook functionality built into **Azure** ‚ûú but we‚Äôre trying not to use those automated tools in these labs.
> 
> This is because we want to get a better sense of the ‚ÄúMethodologies‚Äù behind **Incident Response**.
> 
> Instead of just trying to learn tools that are specific to Azure, for example.
> 
> The goal here it to get some practice on how someone would **Respond to Incidents in a Real SOC Environment**.
>

<br>

<br>

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ûú Post-Incident Activity

- Document Findings.

- Close out the Incident in Sentinel.

## Incident Description

<br>

‚û°Ô∏è This Incident involves observation of potential **Brute Force Attempts against a Windows VM**.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/431719cf-bbda-4eca-a812-1aff0beeff76)

<br>

<br>

## Initial Response Actions

- Verify the Authenticity of the Alert or Report.

- Immediately Isolate the Machine and Change the Password of the affected User.

- Identify the Origin of the Attacks and determine if they are attacking or involved with anything else.

- Determine How and When the attack occurred.

  - Are the NSGs not being locked down? If so ‚ûú check other NSGs.

- Assess the Potential Impact of the Incident.

  - What Type of Account was it?
  - What Permissions did it have?

‚û°Ô∏è **Lock down the NSG** assigned to that VM / Subnet ‚ûú either **Entirely** or to **Only Allow Necessary Traffic**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Reset** the affected **User‚Äôs Password**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Enable MFA**

<br>

<br>

## Post-Incident Activity

<br>

**Document Findings** & **Close out the Incident** in Microsoft Sentinel:

‚úÖ Closing out Incident as **False-Positive** ‚ûú but we'll start the processes for Hardening the NSGs.

<br>

<details close> 
  
**<summary> Close The Incident</summary>**

All of these Alerts have **No Action necessary** ‚ûú it looks like they were Remediated:

```Microsoft Antimalware has taken action to protect this machine from malware or other pottentially unwanted Software```

**8Ô∏è‚É£** If **True Positive** ‚ûú Continue | If **False Positive** ‚ûú Close it out

<br>

‚úÖ Determined to be ‚ûú a **False Positive** ‚ùå

<br>

As far as **Malware** goes ‚ûú this Alert was a **False Positive** because it looks like the User was testing with **EICAR Files**.

üí° This is the **Query** we used to Identify what **Type of Malware was Detected**:

```commandline
SecurityAlert
| where AlertType == "AntimalwareActionTaken"
| where CompromisedEntity == "windows-vm"
| where RemediationSteps !has "No user action is necessary"
| where ExtendedProperties !has "EICAR"

## Containment, Eradication & Recovery

<br>

‚û°Ô∏è None:

We don't need to **Contain, Eradicate or Recover** anything ‚ûú because it's just an **EICAR File**.

## Post-Incident Activity

<br>

**Document Findings** & **Close out the Incident** in Microsoft Sentinel:

‚úÖ Closing out Incident as **False Positive** ‚ùå
